## This project contains list of smart contract UI I worked on and still working on.

### DNS As an NFT

The Domain Name Service Contract is a contract used to create and deploy domain name as an nft, a user can register a domain with an TLD ending with okedomains, A typical example is vitalik.eth. Now instead of the domain name to be based on eth, it'll be based on okedomains.
